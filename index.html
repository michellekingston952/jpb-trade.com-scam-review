    <h1>jpb-trade.com Review – 🚨 Scam Alert</h1>

    <div class="warning">
      ⚠️ <strong>WARNING:</strong> jpb-trade.com is an unregulated and deceptive broker platform that has been reported for scamming traders. Many victims have lost their money after trusting this fraudulent website.
    </div>

    <h2>Is jpb-trade.com Legit or a Scam?</h2>
    <p>
      After extensive research, it is evident that <strong>jpb-trade.com is a scam</strong>. It is not licensed by any recognized financial authority and has no legal right to offer trading services. Despite its professional appearance, this platform is designed to trick traders into depositing funds they will never recover.
    </p>

    <p>
      Victims have described being misled by false profit reports and fake customer service. Withdrawals are blocked, and users are often pressured to deposit even more money under the pretense of unlocking profits or verifying accounts.
    </p>

    <h2>jpb-trade.com Reviews – Victim Complaints</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>❌ “They kept asking for more deposits but never let me withdraw.”</li>
      <li>❌ “The profits they showed were fake. As soon as I tried to withdraw, they vanished.”</li>
      <li>❌ “They tricked me with fake trading results. It’s a complete scam.”</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How jpb-trade.com Carries Out the Scam</h2>
    <p>
      jpb-trade.com uses high-pressure tactics to convince traders to deposit money. Once funds are sent, the platform shows manipulated trading results to keep users hooked. Eventually, when traders try to withdraw their earnings, the platform either blocks their access or demands additional “fees” to release the funds—none of which are ever returned.
    </p>

    <h2>Star Rating for jpb-trade.com</h2>
    <p><strong>Rating:</strong> <span class="stars">★☆☆☆☆</span> (1/5) – Confirmed scam with no regulatory oversight.</p>

    <h2>Final Verdict</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Do not trust jpb-trade.com.</strong> This platform is a fraud operation. It does not process withdrawals, it misleads users with fake promises, and it preys on inexperienced traders. If you’ve already fallen victim, take steps to report and recover your funds.
